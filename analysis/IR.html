Explain the importance of International Relations in the Nuclear Age.”<br /><em>Emphasis on establishing foundational scope and relevance.</em></li><li>  <strong>2011–2013:</strong><br />– <strong>2011, Q.1 (MCQs):</strong> Focus on theoretical literature (e.g., authors like Fukuyama, Carr).<br />– <strong>2013, Q.8:</strong> “Explain why, despite being a target of terrorism, Pakistan’s international allies often express dissatisfaction with Pakistan’s counter terrorism policy…”<br /><em>Increasing demand for critical evaluation and contextual analysis.</em></li><li>  <strong>2014:</strong><br />– <strong>Q.2:</strong> “Discuss evolution and development of the discipline of International Relations; define the dominant factors responsible for and explain their role in the post‑Cold War era.”<br /><em>Shift to historical evolution and analysis.</em></li><li>  <strong>2016:</strong><br />– <strong>Q.2:</strong> “Examine the concept of National Power and its essential ingredients.”<br /><em>Deep theoretical analysis and application to modern state power.</em></li><li>  <strong>2017:</strong><br />– <strong>Q.2:</strong> “What are the essential differences between the liberal internationalist and realist theories? …”<br /><em>Focus on comparative theoretical analysis as well as current regional issues in Q.7 and Q.8.</em></li></ul><p><strong>b.
